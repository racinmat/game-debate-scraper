game-debate-scraper
===================

a webscraper to collect game info from game-debate.com using BeautifulSoup4 and Requests. 

the scraper crawls through all the games found on the page, and collects gameinfo in to a csv formatted text file. all essential info from a gamepage is collected.

i'm adding dataediting (making the collected info more analyzable) scripts as i proceed.

thanks!
